# BooksDirectory
Here I come with another nodeJs project , using the CRUD implementation with express.
EJS is being used as the template engine and Mongodb Atlas is being used to store the data with the help of Mongoose package.
A simple BooksDirectory app where you can add your favourite books with name and author's Name and store them in a database.
 And there is search,edit and delete functionality added. 
 
Get started:

1. run the server on terminal using node or nodemon or just writing npm start .
2. Go to browser and make a request to localhost:3000.

3. you'll get the home page
